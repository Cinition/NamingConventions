                    <p>Welcome to the Naming convention of our project <b>Aquatic Secrets</b>.</p>

                    <p>This document can be seen as a guide line to follow, what i mean by that is that this is more to find the example of the naming you are trying to find, and not a file you read through once just to be over with it.</p>
                    <p>In this document you can find the naming conventions for texture naming, model naming or how they are called in this document "files". Further down you can see example on what the correct way of naming and best practises for programming in this project.</p>

                <div id="ProjectStructure" class="Paragraph">

                            <p>
                                On the right here is the project structure that we will uphold through out the entire project. Our structure is based upon the structure of Tension because of our usage of their in-house game engine TenGine.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To maintain the same structure throughout the project and computers we will be making use of GitLab for our source control. With this tool we'll also be able to work at the same time on the same folder with minimal issues. Because of so called source control we will never have to create a new folder on every version as source control intergrates version histories of all the changes applied to the folder or how it is called in GitLab a "Repository".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are only 2 folders that are important to you. "Art" and "Code" folders. For the Artist only the "Art" folder will be important while the programmers will make use of both.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The "Art" folder is divided into more folder to clerify what the asset is, from "Animation" to "Models" and also "Textures", The file naming of these files with the respective folder will be further discussed in <a class="Reference Content">File Naming</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The "Code" folder is where are the code is for our game, and like the "Art" folder it is divided into subfolders to further categorise what kind of code it is for the game. The code in these folders like the "Art" have a specific naming convention, but differ in where these conventions apply. The <a class="Reference Content">Code Conventions</a> specifiy to the programmer how to name certain "Variables" or "Classes", and the file names are derived from the class they include in their text.

                    <p>
                        In this paragraph you will find our standard for file and folder naming, ofcourse examples included.
                    </p>

                    <p id="FolderNaming" class="h2">Folder Naming</p>

                    <p>
                        The reason for creating new folders is to make the a folder more organised, by organised that means that the different files of a character will be in a character folder, and everything for the environment will be in a environment folder, thus making everything organised.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a new folder has to be created, follow these rules to follow the folder naming convention.

                    <p>
                        Style Guide is about the naming convention used for "Variables", "Methods", "Classes" etc.

                    <p>
                        Parameters need extra explenation as they can unintentionally get named the same as variables, to avoid this problem we use a underscore "_" before the parameters to identify that this parameters overwrites a variables with the same name.

                        Best Practises showcases some optmises and overall cleanliness in code that we will make use of.

                    <p>
                        Switch cases are standard practises as their pay-off is minute to speed but great is visual cleanliness. When the solution to a problem has come down to more than 3 if-else statements then a switch case will be used.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As you can see the switch can be read faster and is therefore also more appealing to the eye.
